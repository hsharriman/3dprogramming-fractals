# Fractals with 3D Programming

## Author: Hwei-Shin Harriman

### Introduction

This project is a Starter repository, providing some structured material to
learn about generating fractals in 3D programming. This repo assumes that you're
somewhat familiar with THREE.js and Javascript.

There are 4 exercises included in this repository, which cover the topics:

- **Exercise 1** Generating 2D Koch snowflakes using Turtle graphics (and
  THREE.js)
- **Exercise 2** Generating a 2D Sierpinski gasket with Turtle graphics (and
  THREE.js)
- **Exercise 3** Generating a 3D Sierpinski gasket by generating tetrahedrons
- **Exercise 4** Rendering a sphere using GLSL and raymarching

Additionally, there are resources for learning how to use raymarching to render
fractals, which are listed below. It is recommended that you check out these
resources after completing the provided exercises.
